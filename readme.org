* dedup
The Unix utility =uniq= removes adjacent duplicates from a =\n=-separated
collection of input strings. This repository contains a completely trivial
program that removes /all/ duplicates from such a collection. The program
preserves the order of the input.

I make no claims about the implementation being optimal. For my current
purposes, it is good enough.
