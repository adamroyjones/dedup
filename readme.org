* dedup
The Unix utility =uniq= removes adjacent duplicates from a =\n=-separated
collection of input strings. This repository contains a program that removes
/all/ duplicates from such a collection. The program preserves the order of the
input.

The implementation is naive and simplistic but, for my current purposes, it is
good enough.

** Installing
#+begin_src sh
go install gitlab.com/adamroyjones/dedup@latest
#+end_src

** Usage
#+begin_src sh
# Deduplicates the input and prints the result to STDOUT.
cat filename | dedup

# Deduplicates the contents of =filename= and prints the result to STDOUT.
dedup filename

# Deduplicates the contents of =filename= and writes the results to =filename=.
dedup -w filename # Overwrites filename.
#+end_src
