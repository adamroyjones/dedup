* dedup
The Unix utility =uniq= only removes adjacent duplicates from a =\n=-separated
collection of input strings. This repository contains a completely trivial
program that removes /all/ duplicates from such a collection. It preserves the
order of the input.

I make no claims about this being optimal. For my purposes, this is good enough.
